# Monetary Policy

DRE’s monetary policy couples two moving pieces — a [capped-inflation curve (500 %-2 000 % APR)](capped-inflation-curve.md) and a [ratcheting “hard floor”](price-hard-floor.md) on risk-free value (RFV) per token — so that supply can keep growing for stakers while the minimum redeemable price rises epoch after epoch.&#x20;

The scheme converts every external dollar into three buckets, keeps inflation tethered to real collateral and lets the protocol advertise high yields without repeating the hyper-inflation mistakes of early OlympusDAO.
