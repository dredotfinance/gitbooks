# Staking RZR - sRZR

Staking RZR is the foundational way for participants to align with the RZR Protocol’s mission of efficient asset allocation and continuous value growth. When you stake RZR, you lock your tokens into the protocol and receive sRZR in return, representing your share of both ongoing Harberger-tax revenue and bond-driven treasury growth.

Unlike simply holding RZR, staking transforms passive balances into an active yield-bearing position—and grants you governance influence via your sRZR balance.

OlympusDAO pioneered the idea of rebasing tokens—automatically minting new tokens for stakers when the treasury grows through bond sales—to convert speculative inflows into yield. ￼ RZR Protocol augments that by adding Harberger-tax receipts as a second, steady revenue stream into PCV, ensuring rebases persist even if bond demand cools.

Here are a few benefits of staking RZR

- **Predictable Yield** - You earn a share of every Harberger-tax dollar and every bond-sale dollar entering the treasury, creating a baseline APY that persists even if speculative bond demand cools.
- **Auto-Compounding** - Rebases are applied directly to your balance each epoch—no claim or restake steps required—so you capture every increment of yield effortlessly.
- **Governance Alignment** - By converting RZR into sRZR, you lock tokens into active protocol use, ensuring that those with the greatest stake also have the strongest voice in steering the system.
- **Capital Efficiency** - Staked RZR backs new bond emissions, reinforcing the protocol-controlled value (PCV) per token and helping maintain the 1 RZR ≥ $1 backing rule.

Consider a simplified example:

1. You stake 1 000 RZR, declaring a value of $10 000 (so your Harberger tax is 5 % APR = $500/yr). &#x20;
2. That $500 goes into PCV, alongside other stakers’ tax payments and any bond proceeds. &#x20;
3. If the protocol’s policy sets an 8-hour rebase of 0.1 %, every sRZR holder—including you—earns 0.1 % of their balance (1 000 × 0.001 = 1 sRZR) that epoch, funded by the total PCV inflow. &#x20;

## How Staking Works?

When you stake RZR:

1. **Lock and Mint -** You deposit RZR into the staking contract, which instantly mints an equivalent amount of sRZR (your “stake receipt”). Your RZR remains protocol-owned until you choose to unstake.
2. **Earning Rebases -** Every protocol epoch (e.g. 8 hours), the controller calculates a rebase rate based on new Harberger-tax inflows and bond sales. Your sRZR balance increases by this rate, compounding your position without any manual intervention.
3. **Governance Power** - Your sRZR balance also determines your voting weight in DrDre governance. More sRZR means greater influence over proposals like tax rates, bond terms, and treasury allocations.
4. **Unstaking and Redemption** - When you decide to exit, you burn your sRZR to reclaim RZR at a 1:1 ratio plus any accrued rebases. Unstaking typically has a short cooldown (e.g. one epoch) to ensure treasury stability.

## Game Theory&#x20;

When you stake RZR (converting it into sRZR), you become both a beneficiary and a contributor to the protocol’s Harberger-tax revenue stream—and that dual role can seem confusing at first. Fundamentally, every sRZR holder declares a value for their staked position and pays a small, continuous tax on that declared value; those tax payments flow straight into the Protocol-Controlled Value (PCV), which then underwrites the periodic rebase rewards that all stakers receive.

In other words, while each staker remits Harberger tax on their own self-assessment, every staker also shares pro-rata in the aggregate PCV-backed rebases—so tax outflows from some positions become yield inflows for the collective staking pool. The mechanism balances incentives: if you undervalue your position to minimize tax, someone else can “snipe” it at that low price; if you overvalue it, you pay more tax but strengthen PCV, which boosts everyone’s future rebases.
