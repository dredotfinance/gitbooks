# Welcome

Welcome to the DRE Protocol documentation. Here you’ll find everything you need to know about DRE, our dynamic currency, and DrDre, its governance and insurance token. Together, they form a two-token system designed to keep digital assets both liquid and efficiently allocated, while providing robust safeguards against treasury shortfalls.

By integrating continuous self-assessment and taxation mechanisms, DRE ensures that assets are held by those who value them most, promoting active participation and reducing speculative hoarding.

Key Components

* DRE (Digital Resource Exchange): The primary currency used within the protocol for transactions, asset valuations, and tax payments.
* DrDre (Decentralized Resource Director): The governance token granting holders voting rights on protocol parameters, including tax rates, asset categories, and treasury allocations.

If at any time the terminologies used in the documentation aren't clear or confusing, feel free to head over to the [Glossary section](other/glossary.md) for term definitions or join our [Discord](http://discord.dre.finance/) for more information.

## Key Features

* **Continuous Price Discovery**: Every asset on DRE is always for sale at its self-assessed price, ensuring trading opportunities whenever valuation shifts.
* **Harberger Tax Revenue:** A predictable, ongoing tax on declared asset values that builds protocol-controlled value without selling tokens.
* **Seamless Compounding Bonds:** Our “4-4-4” bond integrates vesting and auto-restaking over three 4-day cycles, capturing every epoch’s yield without manual steps.
* **Dual-Token Architecture:** DRE drives day-to-day liquidity and yield; DrDre aligns governance incentives and serves as a pre-funded insurance layer.
* **Flexible Governance:** Proposals cover tax rates, bond discounts, surplus thresholds and emergency pause controls, all enacted via on-chain votes.
* **Robust Safeguards:** A multi-tier defense ladder—from reward throttling to inverse bonds, surplus-buffer draws, stake slashing and insurance auctions—keeps the protocol solvent under stress.
